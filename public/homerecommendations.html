  									<h2>Environment variables</h2>
  									<div class="row">
  										<div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Topography</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>The topography of the terrain together with the type of vegetation and weather are the three elements that mark the behavior of fire. Obviously you can not make changes in the situation of your house, but you can be aware that this makes you more vulnerable to a forest fire. On a slope, the fire rises more quickly.</li>
  											</ul>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Water supplies</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>If you live in a place where there is water shortage, it is important to take into account that the vegetation will be dry and therefore increases the flammability of the area. It is important to have enough water supplies in case of forest fire. For urbanizations, the creation of water supply points every 200 meters is necessary.</li>
  											</ul>
  										</div>
  									</div>

                    <h2>Next your house</h2>
  									<div class="row">
  										<div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Access way</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>Access to your house should be enough to let big vehicles come for fire extinction activities and evacuation. It’s also important to have routes of evacuation strategically located and with enough signs to mark clearly the way to evacuate. The recommendation is to have paved way, free of vegetation and wide enough.</li>
  											</ul>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>High-tension towers</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>If the house is near high-tension towers, it is important to monitor the condition of the vegetation near the electrical towers. Contact to the Town Hall if there are vegetation near them.</li>
  											</ul>
  										</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Area Next the house</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>Take care of the surroundings of your house. It’s important to follow the recommendations from local emergency teams related to the distances between the house and vegetation and also between trees. The diameter of the protection around a house should be four times the vegetation height. The distance between trees must be 3 meters or more. It depends on the slope and the distance on some cases should be 6 with mid slope or 9 meters for high slope.</li>
  											</ul>
  										</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Fence</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>Avoid the use of highly inflammable species as pines, oaks, palms, etc. Use preventive gardening  to create structures of ornamental vegetation to become more resistant to the fire.</li>
  											</ul>
  										</div>
  									</div>

                    <h2>Your house</h2>
  									<div class="row">
  										<div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Outer walls</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>Avoid combustible material (fuelwoods, butane ...) near the structure of the house and near the weakest points like roof, chimney, doors or windows. If you have gas tanks or diesel oil, remove them from the house. Avoid the climbing plants.</li>
  											</ul>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Leaves</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>Avoid accumulation of leaves</li>
  											</ul>
  										</div>
                      <div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Roof</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>It is important to avoid the construction of the roof with inflammable materials. Clean the roof avoiding accumulation of leaves and vegetation. Check it from time to time, specially before summer.</li>
  											</ul>
  										</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Barbecue</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>Be very careful with the use of barbecues. Check the local legislation and recommendations to have them.</li>
  											</ul>
  										</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12">
  											<h3>Water source</h3>
  											<ul class="alt">
  												<li>Increase the protection of your house with an equipment of fire protection. Check your water sources. Make sure that the hose of the garden is enough long to arrive everywhere and even better if you have special hose for fires. Consider to have a water pump of petrol to guarantee water pressure in case of emergency.</li>
